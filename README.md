# CYART SOC Report

This repository contains my **SOC Fundamentals and Practical Implementation Report**, documenting both theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice in cybersecurity operations. The report covers core SOC concepts such as log management, security monitoring, incident response, and documentation standards, along with practical implementations like building an ELK stack pipeline, creating Snort IDS rules, performing Nessus vulnerability scans, using Osquery for process monitoring, and detecting brute-force attacks through event log analysis.

The goal of this report is to demonstrate how a Security Operations Center functions in real-world scenariosâ€”covering proactive threat detection, continuous monitoring, and incident handling. It highlights practical exercises that process over **32,000 security events**, identify system vulnerabilities, and correlate multi-source data for threat investigation.
